## The start of my journey to become a runner (and a triathlete)

I miss the days I used to run back in middle school for the spectrum of sports I played. Football, basketball, track, volleyball and throwball. Running back then was just to condition myself for the sport. I wanted to change that.

It was time to get back to fitness and although I did not play a sport to be conditioned for, I thought why don't I run and try to become better at it. That set off the ball in Decemeber of 2023 and I look forward to how things go in 2024.

### My goals for 2024:
- Run a sub-30 minute 5K.
- Run a 10K.
- Run a 21K (HM).
- Run a total of 1000KM in 2024.

### My gear for 2024
- ASICS Gel-Nimbus 25
- ASICS Gel-Contend 4B+
- Crocs (Sports Mode)
