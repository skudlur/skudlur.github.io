## My obsession with expensive audio peripherals

My love for music started back in school when I was introduced to playing the guitar by my dear friend Joyson Gilbert Paul. Music was one amongst the many cool things he introduced me to. I started out jamming to tracks ranging hip-hop to classic rock. I still cherish the moments I had in school; forming a band for the first time "One Peace" and playing rock in my Catholic school. All those moments spent in the music room jamming with my friends and music teachers. I got my first electric guitar gifted to me when I was in high school, and there my journey with audiophilia and music engineering started.

There began my obsession with VST plugins and DAWs. It slowly crept on to becoming audiophilia when Chai sir introduced me to IEMs. Now, I am on a journey to accumulate a bunch of audio peripherals to give me the best aural experience.
