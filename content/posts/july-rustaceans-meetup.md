## I gave a talk titled "Building lightweight command-line tools with Rust"

On July 8th, I gave a talk in the July Rustaceans Meetup hosted by Rust India where I showcased my RISC-V emulator named "RISCulator" which is built using Rust. It was a great day and bunch of awesome people sharing knowledge about Rust. I believe Rust will be a dominating programming language because of it's community-driven nature and it shows great potential to be used in Electronic Design Automation and other VLSI use-cases.

RISCulator is a simple RV32I emulator. An emulator, simple put, is a software system that behaves like a hardware system. In this case, RISCulator behaves like a 32-bit RISC-V CPU with the "I" extension. It also displays how the decoding and execution of each instruction is done.
