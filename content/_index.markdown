## _Living life, one bit at a time._

I am a postgraduate (MSc by Research) student at the School of Informations, University of Edinburgh. I am intrigued by hardware and software architecture and how the development of these have evolved over the years and converged into the co-design realm for maximum performance. Besides my lab work, I strive to contribute to my own as well as other open source projects. I also guide undergraduate students interested in contributing to open source projects and research projects. 

If you are interested to work with me, hire me or would like to share your playlist - reach out to me on LinkedIn.
